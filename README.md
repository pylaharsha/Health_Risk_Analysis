# **Health Risk Prediction Project**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict the health risk score of a patient based on various lifestyle and health metrics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we seek to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare providers in assessing patient risk and making informed decisions regarding preventative care and treatment.

## **Project Description**
Health risk prediction is a critical task in the healthcare industry. By accurately predicting health risk scores, medical professionals can identify high-risk patients early and provide targeted interventions to improve patient outcomes. This project explores the use of regression models to predict health risk scores using a dataset that includes both lifestyle factors and health metrics.

### **Objectives:**
- **Collect and preprocess data** related to patient health metrics and lifestyle factors.
- **Train and evaluate multiple regression models** to predict health risk scores.
- **Compare the performance of different models** using evaluation metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Provide a scalable and easy-to-use prediction tool** for healthcare practitioners.

### **Dataset**
The dataset `health_risk_data.csv` contains 200,000 records with the following columns:
- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `BMI`: Body Mass Index
- `Blood_Pressure`: Blood pressure level
- `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol level
- `Smoking_Status`: Whether the patient is a smoker (`Yes`/`No`)
- `Physical_Activity`: Level of physical activity (`Low`/`Medium`/`High`)
- `Diet_Quality`: Quality of diet (`Poor`/`Average`/`Good`)
- `Health_Risk_Score`: Health risk score (1-10)

### **Preprocessing**
The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. This ensures that the data is clean and suitable for training machine learning models.

### **Model Training and Evaluation**
Several regression models are trained and evaluated:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

The performance of these models is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**

## **Results**
The performance of different regression models was evaluated using the metrics mentioned above. The results are summarized as follows:

| **Model**                      | **MAE** | **RMSE** | **R²**  |
|-----------------------------|------|------|------|
| **Linear Regression**           | 1.96 | 2.41 | 0.09 |
| **Support Vector Regression**   | 2.42 | 2.82 | -0.27|
| **Random Forest Regressor**     | 2.33 | 2.64 | -0.12|
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | 2.15 | 2.48 | 0.01 |

### **Conclusion**
The **Linear Regression** model performed the best among the models tested, based on the lowest MAE and RMSE values and the highest R² value, although it is still relatively low. This suggests that while linear regression provides a baseline, there is significant room for improvement.


## **Future Work**
To enhance the performance of the health risk prediction model, the following areas can be explored:

- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to better capture the relationships in the data. For instance, interaction terms between different health metrics and lifestyle factors might reveal more insights.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the hyperparameters for the Gradient Boosting Regressor and Random Forest Regressor to improve their performance. Techniques such as grid search or random search can be used to find the best hyperparameters.
- **Exploring Additional Models:** Trying other machine learning models, such as neural networks or ensemble methods that combine multiple models, might yield better results. Models like XGBoost or deep learning models could be considered.
- **Improving Data Quality:** Ensuring the data is clean and representative of the problem domain. Collecting more relevant features, such as family medical history or genetic factors, could provide additional predictive power.
- **Cross-Validation:** Using cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability. This helps in validating the model's performance across different subsets of data.
- **Deployment:** Developing a user-friendly application for healthcare providers to input patient data and receive health risk predictions in real-time. This could involve creating a web or mobile application.
- **Model Interpretability:** Enhancing the interpretability of the models to provide healthcare providers with insights into which factors contribute most to a patient's health risk score. Techniques like SHAP values can be used to explain model predictions.
